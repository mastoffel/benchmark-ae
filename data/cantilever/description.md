# Cantilever datasets

from Zack Xuereb Conti

### 1) cantilever/

**raw data**: beam_demo_CSVdata_2targets.csv

Dataset with 996 data points, input space is pseudo-randomly sampled. from the finite element analysis (frame) of a very simple cantilever beam where span of the beam, and it's cross-sectional depth are the inputs while maximum deflection and weight are the targets/outputs


### 2) cantilever_truss/

**raw data**: Nervi_truss_datasets.zip (multiple dataset sizes)

This is a more intricate cantilever truss design example whose geometry is parameterised by a set of geometric variables. In this dataset, deflection and weight are the targets/outputs while the remaining variables are inputs, controlling the geometry. The folder contains simulated data of the same problem for multiple dataset sizes.
