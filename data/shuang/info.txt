I have attached the dataset of three subjects. 
There are csv files for both 500 and 1000 samples for two cases and the other one cases only have 500 samples. 
The input parameters are the first 50 columns and the output parameter is column 50: 'QRSd'. 
The three cases give R2score of 0.46,0.28 and 0.27 when using the GPEmulator, 
and shows slight differences for training on 500  or 1000 samples.
