Info:

I have some FEM simulation results (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gBU3ZHLvVIvr87DXosJupowUcny1xLgJ?usp=sharing). There are 1296 simulations with each simulation having the input of [kx, ky, kz, krz] = [10^x, 10^y, 10^z, 10^rz], and output is the structural vibration response. For example, in the file folder, a file named  '0_0_0_0FRF' is the output with [kx, ky, kz, krz] = [10^0, 10^0, 10^0, 10^0]. Hope that can help you and please let me know if you need any extra information.
